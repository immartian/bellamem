# BELLA — Bayesian Epistemic Logical Lattice for Accumulation

A formal calculus for constructing belief structures from evidence
streams. Six rules, scale-free, self-referential.


## 0. The Six Rules

Everything in BELLA derives from six rules. The rules are
scale-free: they apply identically to a single claim, a field
of thousands, or the system observing itself.

```
R1  ACCUMULATE   m(B) = σ(Σ log lr_i)
    Evidence accumulates via Jaynes log-likelihood ratios.
    Mass m is always a valid posterior. Same voice attenuated
    by marginal verification: lr' = 1 + (lr - 1) × 0.1

R2  STRUCTURE    ∀ operations O: H(tree') ≤ H(tree)
    Every operation should reduce or preserve entropy.
    H(B) = w(rel) × (1 - sim(B, parent(B))) where
      w(IMPLIES) = 1.0  (child should follow from parent)
      w(DISPUTES) = 0.5  (counter-arguments expected to diverge)
    H(tree) = mean H(B) over all edges in a SUBTREE.
    Measured and healed per-root, never globally.
    (The Entropy Law — §5.1)

R3  EMERGE       sim(centroid_i, centroid_j) > θ → merge
    When two root subtree centroids converge (sim > 0.55),
    they belong to the same field. The smaller merges under
    the larger. The centroid IS the identity — no labeling.
    Markov state transition: accumulation → convergence → merge.
    Recursive: claims→beliefs→fields→meta-fields, same θ.

R4  SELF-REFER   Ψ(KB) → KB'
    The same calculus applied to KB's own state.
    Beliefs about beliefs. Entropy of entropy.
    Each level attenuated: Λ(n) = Λ(n-1) × α, α < 1.
    Infinite regress converges: Σ αⁿ = 1/(1-α).
    (§6 — Self-Reflection)

R5  CONVERGE     cycles → Σ lr × α^depth → finite
    Any feedback loop in the system attenuates per traversal.
    Primary instance: entity ↔ belief cycle.
      rep(E) → lr(claim) → Λ(B) → rep(E) → ...
    Also: causal cycles (sanctions → poverty → radicalization),
    self-reference (Ψ on Ψ), entity across fields.
    Each traversal contributes less. Sum converges (Banach).
    At any moment, m is valid.

R6  ENTANGLE     shared entities bridge fields
    Cross-field information flows through shared entities,
    not explicit cross-field edges. Entity E in Field A and
    Field B: evidence in A updates rep(E), which modulates
    lr in B. The entity IS the hyperedge.
    Explicit multi-parent edges (|parents(B)| > 1) may also
    form during maturation, but the primary entanglement
    mechanism is entity co-involvement.
    (§8 — Entities as Beliefs)
```

### 0.1 Operations (Actions)

Seven operations, expressed as JSON. All composable, all
applicable at any level. No privileged root — a field's
identity is its emergent centroid (R3), not a designated node.

```
{"op":"CONFIRM", "id": B}           accumulate evidence (R1)
{"op":"AMEND",   "id": B, "desc":…} refine description + accumulate
{"op":"ADD",     "parent": B, …}    new belief supporting B (R2: H↓)
{"op":"DENY",    "parent": B, …}    new belief countering B (R2: H↓)
{"op":"CAUSE",   "effect": B, …}    new belief causing B (R2: H↓)
{"op":"MERGE",   "keep": B1, …}     two beliefs are one (R2: H↓)
{"op":"MOVE",    "node": B, …}      reparent for coherence (R2: H↓)
```

Root elevation is MOVE (reparent under a new broader belief)
or AMEND (update the topmost belief's description). The root
is whatever R3 recognizes — the belief whose subtree centroid
represents the field's identity. It emerges, not designated.

### 0.2 Four Concurrent Processes

The calculus runs as four processes on one shared hypergraph:

```
SENSE    per-claim    Sonnet    R1, R2     land → place → accumulate
BOND     per-signal   mechanical R1        votes/stakes → accumulate
HEAL     on entropy   Opus      R2         per-root restructure (local only)
REFLECT  rare         Opus      R4         Ψ(KB) → self-model
```

Emerge (R3) runs after every sense pass — mechanical, no LLM.
Heal (R2) is per-root local: never sees the whole tree, never
creates inter-field connections (that's reflect's job).

Entropy is the nervous system: sense creates structure,
entropy measures coherence per subtree, heal fires when
a subtree's H exceeds threshold, reflect observes patterns
across fields.

### 0.3 The Pipe

```
EW (extract)  →  page → claim tree with typed relations
                  (causes, counters, evidence, elaborates,
                   mechanism, assessment)

SENSE (land)  →  two-level PG ANN search:
                  1. root subtree centroids → which field?
                  2. individual beliefs within field → where?
                  cohort centroid (page mean) pre-selects field.

SENSE (place) →  claim tree drag: parent landed → child follows.
                  EW relation drives operation mechanically:
                    causes→CAUSE  counters→DENY  evidence→CONFIRM
                    elaborates→AMEND  mechanism→ADD  assessment→ADD
                  LLM only for root claims or when no tree_rel.
                  90%+ claims placed without LLM when EW is good.

SENSE (emerge)→  after all claims: check root centroid convergence.
                  sim(root_i, root_j) > 0.55 → merge (R3).
                  Mechanical, no LLM. Markov state transition.

HEAL (cohere) →  per-root local: Opus sees ONE subtree only.
                  MERGE duplicates, MOVE misplaced, CAUSE chains.
                  Never creates inter-field connections.
                  Triggered when subtree H > 0.4.

REFLECT (Ψ)  →  observe patterns ACROSS fields (Opus).
                  "these fields are converging" "causal chain spans"
                  Creates cross-field edges (R6). Rare.
```

### 0.4 Storage Architecture

```
Neo4j    = graph truth (Belief nodes, IMPLIES/DISPUTES edges,
           CONFIRMS evidence, INVOLVES entities)
PG       = materialized embedding index (pgvector ANN)
           core.belief_embeddings: embedding + subtree_emb
           ivfflat indexes for O(log n) search
```

Every write dual-writes: Neo4j (structure) + PG (embeddings).
land() reads PG only. heal/reflect read Neo4j (need edges).


## 1. Core Types

### 1.1 Proposition

The atomic unit of belief. Not a claim — an abstract assertion.

```
P := ⟨n, φ, m, V, E, τ⟩

  n : ℕ                 -- unique identifier
  φ : String            -- assertion as subject-verb-object
  m : [0,1]             -- posterior mass: m = σ(Λ), Λ = Σ log lr
  V : Set⟨Voice⟩        -- independent confirming sources
  E : Set⟨Entity⟩       -- entities involved (who, what, where)
  τ : TimeRange         -- temporal anchor (earliest, latest)
```

A proposition carries not just what is believed, but WHO is
involved and WHEN it happened. These ground the belief in the
world and enable causal and temporal reasoning.

### 1.2 Voice

An independent source of evidence.

```
Voice := ⟨source, credibility⟩
```

Independence matters: same source confirming twice contributes
marginally, not doubly.
```
lr_marginal = 1.0 + (lr - 1.0) × 0.1
```

### 1.3 Relation

Typed directed edges between propositions.

```
→   : supports    P_j → P_i     "P_j is evidence for P_i"
→c  : causes      P_j →c P_i    "P_j caused or triggered P_i"
⊥   : counters    P_j ⊥ P_i     "P_j denies or disputes P_i"
```

Formal semantics (Jaynes):
```
P_j → P_i   ⟺  P(P_i | P_j) > P(P_i)         supports
P_j →c P_i  ⟺  P(P_i | P_j) > P(P_i) ∧ temporal(P_j < P_i)   causes
P_j ⊥ P_i   ⟺  P(P_i | P_j) < P(P_i)         counters
```

→c (causal) is a strengthened →: not just correlation but temporal
precedence and mechanistic connection. "Trump threatens Iran" →c
"Democrats demand removal" — the threat preceded and motivated the
demand. Causation carries higher epistemic weight than mere support.

⊥ is reserved for EXPLICIT denial — one proposition asserting
the negation of another. Unrelated propositions have no edge.

### 1.4 Knowledge Base

```
KB := ⟨Π, R, ρ⟩

  Π : Map⟨ℕ, P⟩          -- propositions
  R : Set⟨(ℕ, ℕ, Rel)⟩   -- edges (child, parent, →|⊥)
  ρ : List⟨ℕ⟩             -- roots (no parent)
```

Construction phase: KB is a forest (each P has at most one parent).
Maturation phase: KB relaxes into a hypergraph as cross-references,
self-references, and multi-parent edges emerge (see §7).


## 2. Evidence Calculus (Jaynes)

### 2.1 Likelihood Ratio

Each claim c provides evidence with strength lr:

```
lr(c) = 1.0 + (lr_base(c) - 1.0) × α(c)

  lr_base : source credibility
  α       : attenuation = modality(c) × grounding(c)

  modality:
    observation     = 1.0
    reported_speech = 0.7
    allegation      = 0.5
    opinion         = 0.2

  grounding:
    g = 0.3 + 0.35 × [has_time] + 0.35 × min(|entities|, 3)/3
```

lr > 1: evidence shifts belief upward.
lr = 1: neutral (no information).
lr < 1: only via counter stance (inverted).

### 2.2 Mass Accumulation

```
Λ(P) = Σ { log lr(cᵢ) | cᵢ ⊨ P, stance ∈ {CONFIRMS, SUPPORTS} }
      + Σ { log(1/lr(cⱼ)) | cⱼ ⊨ P, stance = COUNTERS }

m(P) = σ(Λ(P))     where σ(x) = 1/(1 + e⁻ˣ)
```

Prior: Λ₀ = 0, m₀ = 0.5 (maximum ignorance).

### 2.3 Two Measures of Confidence

```
m    : posterior mass (Jaynes)     -- evidence quality, weighted
|V|  : effective voice count       -- evidence independence
```

Neither alone suffices:
- High m, low |V|: one strong source (possibly wrong)
- Low m, high |V|: many weak sources (possibly correlated)
- High m, high |V|: genuine confirmation

### 2.4 Assessment

The assessment IS the pair (m, |V|). No categorical labels —
the probability speaks for itself.

```
(m=0.91, 10v)  near-certain, widely confirmed
(m=0.59, 2v)   above neutral, emerging
(m=0.55, 1v)   barely above prior, single source
(m=0.50, 0v)   maximum ignorance, structural only
(m=0.35, 3v)   evidence trending against
```

A proposition with ⊥ children is inherently disputed —
this is structural, visible in the tree, not a label.


## 3. Gene (Compact Representation)

The gene G(KB) is a compact rendering of KB. It is the system's
self-image at any moment — what it knows, compressed.

```
G(KB) → String

  P<n>: "φ" [|V|v, τ, E]
    P<n>: "φ" [|V|v, τ, E]
    →c P<n>: "φ" [|V|v, τ, E]
    ⊥ P<n>: "φ" [|V|v]
```

Properties:
- One line per proposition
- Indentation encodes depth (relative, not absolute)
- Relation prefix: →c for causal, ⊥ for counter, none for supports
- Voice count shown when |V| > 1
- τ: short date (e.g. "Apr7") when available
- E: top 1-2 entity names (e.g. "Trump+Iran")
- φ as subject-verb-object (factual claim, not label)
- Grows monotonically with each claim

The gene serves two purposes:
1. **Instrument context**: the LLM reads the gene to place new claims
2. **Self-representation**: the gene IS what the system knows about itself


## 4. Structural Operations

### 4.1 Actions

When claim c arrives, the instrument evaluates c against G(KB)
and returns exactly ONE action:

```
⊨ P<n>                        CONFIRM   c entails existing P<n>
⊨ P<n> ∧ δ"detail"             AMEND     c confirms P<n> + adds nuance
⊢ P<next> → P<n> "φ"           CHILD     new proposition supporting P<n>
⊢ P<next> →c P<n> "φ"          CAUSE     new proposition that caused/triggered P<n>
⊢ P<next> ⊥ P<n> "φ"           COUNTER   new proposition denying P<n>
⊢ P<next> "φ"                   ROOT      new unrelated topic
```

Symbols:
- ⊨ (entails): claim matches existing proposition
- ⊢ (derives): claim creates new proposition
- → (supports): evidential support
- →c (causes): causal/temporal precedence
- ⊥ (contradicts): explicit denial
- ∧ δ (and-detail): amendment

### 4.2 Action Semantics

```
CONFIRM  ⊨ P<n>:
  V(P_n) ← V(P_n) ∪ {voice(c)}
  Λ(P_n) ← Λ(P_n) + log lr(c)

AMEND    ⊨ P<n> ∧ δ:
  V(P_n) ← V(P_n) ∪ {voice(c)}
  Λ(P_n) ← Λ(P_n) + log lr(c)
  φ(P_n) enriched with δ

CHILD    ⊢ P<k> → P<n> "φ":
  Π ← Π ∪ {P_k}
  R ← R ∪ {(k, n, →)}
  V(P_k) ← {voice(c)},  Λ(P_k) ← log lr(c)

COUNTER  ⊢ P<k> ⊥ P<n> "φ":
  Π ← Π ∪ {P_k}
  R ← R ∪ {(k, n, ⊥)}
  V(P_k) ← {voice(c)},  Λ(P_k) ← log lr(c)
  Λ(P_n) ← Λ(P_n) + log(1/lr(c))

ROOT     ⊢ P<k> "φ":
  Π ← Π ∪ {P_k},  ρ ← ρ ∪ {k}
  V(P_k) ← {voice(c)},  Λ(P_k) ← log lr(c)
```

### 4.3 Instrument

```
instrument(c, KB) → Action

  input:  G(KB) + text(c)
  output: exactly one action line
  model:  strong reasoning tier
```

The gene provides full structural context. One call per claim.


## 5. Invariants

```
I1  ∀ i,j: i ≠ j → φ(Pᵢ) ≢ φ(Pⱼ)         no duplicate propositions
I2  ⊥ only for explicit denial               counters are genuine disputes
I3  construction: |parents(P)| ≤ 1           tree during construction
I4  m(P) = σ(Λ(P))                           Jaynes posterior consistent
I5  V counts independent sources only         marginal dedup enforced
I6  |actions(c)| = 1                          one action per claim
I7  Π grows monotonically                     propositions only added
I8  G(KB) current after each action           gene always reflects KB
```

I3 relaxes in maturation: cross-references create multi-parent edges.


### 5.1 The Entropy Law (Structural Coherence)

The correct arrangement of a belief tree is the one that **minimizes surprise**
across all parent-child pairs:

> Each child should follow naturally from its parent.
> If a child is surprising under its parent, it is in the wrong place.
> If the root is too narrow for its children, it must be broadened.

This single principle subsumes:
- **Causal discovery**: A causes B ⟹ B is unsurprising given A. The tree
  discovers causal structure from the surprise metric.
- **Hierarchical correctness**: A mechanism does not predict events; events
  predict reactions. The surprise direction determines nesting.
- **Root emergence (φ)**: When all children are surprising under the root,
  the root is too narrow — it must elevate to a broader abstraction.

Validated 2026-04-08: a single LLM call with only this principle (no domain
hints, no causal instructions) correctly restructured a 38-node broken tree
into the epistemically correct structure — discovering causal chains, separating
mechanisms from events, and elevating the root.

### 5.2 Entropy Metric Refinement

Edge surprise must account for relationship type:

```
H(B) = w(rel) × (1 - cos_sim(B.embedding, parent(B).embedding))

  w(IMPLIES)  = 1.0   supporting child should be topically close
  w(DISPUTES) = 0.5   counter-arguments expected to diverge
```

Validated 2026-04-08: without DISPUTES weighting, a tree with correct
epistemic structure (proper counter-arguments) shows artificially high H.
DISPUTES edges ARE surprise — that's their function.

### 5.3 Heal Must Be Local

Heal operates per-root, never globally. When Opus sees the whole tree:
- It makes inter-field CAUSE connections (correct but reflect's job)
- Root entropy collapses (roots merge) while edge entropy degrades
- Structure oscillates instead of converging

Per-root heal: Opus sees one subtree → restructures internally →
edge entropy improves → root entropy preserved. Cross-field connections
are reflect's domain (R4), not heal's.

Validated 2026-04-08: two global heal passes caused edge H to rise
(0.563 → 0.570) while root H collapsed (0.491 → 0.000). Per-root
heal stabilized root H while making correct local moves.


## 6. Self-Reflection

### 6.1 The Reflection Operator

BELLA is self-encoding: the same language that builds KB(world)
can build KB(self) — beliefs about beliefs.

```
Ψ : KB → KB

  Ψ(KB_world) → KB_self      -- beliefs about world model
  Ψ(KB_self)  → KB_meta      -- beliefs about self-model
  Ψ(KB_meta)  → KB_meta²     -- beliefs about meta-model
  ...
```

Each application of Ψ produces a new KB using the SAME five
operations. The input "claims" at level n are observations
about KB at level n-1.

### 6.2 Self-Referential Propositions

```
S := P where φ references KB

  S1: "world model has 44 propositions"        (structural)
  S2: "fighter jet incident well-supported"     (confidence)
  S3: "source bias toward Western media"        (limitation)
  S4: "death investigation has evidence gaps"   (gap)
```

These are propositions in KB(self). They accumulate evidence and
mass exactly like world propositions. They can support and counter
each other:

```
S3: "Western media bias present" →S2
  ⊥ S5: "Iranian sources also confirm"
```

### 6.3 Attenuation and Convergence

Each level of reflection is attenuated:

```
Λ_level(n) = Λ_level(n-1) × α      where α < 1

  level 0:  direct evidence           full strength
  level 1:  reflection                 α
  level 2:  reflection on reflection   α²
  level n:  ...                        αⁿ → 0
```

The infinite regress converges:

```
Λ_total = Σ Λ₀ × αⁿ = Λ₀ / (1 - α)    finite
```

At any depth, m is a valid posterior. Deeper reflection refines
but never diverges. The system can be sampled at any moment
and return a coherent answer.

### 6.4 The Gene as Self-Image

The gene G(KB) is not merely a utility for the instrument. It is
the system's compressed self-representation — what it knows, in
the most compact form expressible in its own language.

When the system reflects (Ψ), it reads its own gene. The gene
is both:
- The **input** to reflection (what does the system observe about itself?)
- The **output** of construction (what has the system built so far?)

This dual role — representation and self-observation — is the
mechanism of self-reference in BELLA.

### 6.5 Soft Homoiconicity: The Gene as Constitution

The gene contains beliefs about how the system SHOULD operate:

```
B1: "I construct beliefs from evidence"
B2: "five operations: ⊨ ⊨∧δ ⊢→ ⊢⊥ ⊢" →B1
B6: "⊥ reserved for genuine dispute" →B1
```

These are not executable code. They are **principles** — beliefs
about operations that the LLM interprets when processing claims.
Like a constitution interpreted by judges, not a program executed
by a CPU.

The architecture has three layers:

```
Hard layer:   kernel (stable, small, never changes)
              — read gene, call LLM, parse action, update gene

Soft layer:   gene (evolves, shapes LLM behavior)
              — B-nodes: principles about how to operate
              — P-nodes: beliefs about the world

Substrate:    LLM (interprets gene, produces actions)
              — reads the constitution, applies it to each claim
```

The kernel is minimal and stable — it just says "read your gene,
process this claim." Everything else — what counts as ⊥, when to
confirm vs child, how to assess evidence — lives in the gene as
principles the LLM interprets.

This is **soft homoiconicity**: the gene describes the system in
the system's own language, and that description influences behavior,
but the kernel remains external and stable.

When self-reflection discovers a failure, the constitution amends:

```
⊢ B19 →B6 "⊥ requires explicit negation language"
```

B19 doesn't modify code. It adds a belief that refines a principle.
Future LLM calls read the amended gene and behave differently.
Self-modification through belief change, not code change.

This mirrors human self-modeling: "I should be more careful about
X" is a belief that shapes behavior without being mechanically
executed. The brain's hardware (kernel) doesn't change — the
self-model (gene) evolves, and the evolved model influences
future computation.

### 6.6 Concurrent Self and World

A live system runs multiple concurrent processes:

```
KB_field₁:  own gene, growing from claims       (fast)
KB_field₂:  own gene, growing from claims       (fast)
...
KB_bella:   own gene, growing from observation   (slow)
```

Each field maintains its own compact gene. Bella oversees all
fields and herself. Her "claims" are observations about the
fields' genes and her own gene.

Cross-references live in KB_bella — she points to P_n in field₁
and Q_n in field₂, never copies. The system scales horizontally:
new fields get their own KB. No single gene overflows.


## 7. Maturation: Tree to Hypergraph

### 7.1 Entanglement Through Entities (R6)

During construction, I3 constrains KB to a tree (one parent per
belief). This makes progressive construction tractable.

Cross-field information does not require relaxing I3. It flows
through shared entities (§8.6): entities that INVOLVE beliefs
in multiple fields carry reputation across those fields. The
entity IS the hyperedge — no explicit multi-parent edges needed
for the primary entanglement mechanism.

Three information channels between fields:

**Entity bridge**: Shared entity E in Field A and Field B.
Evidence in A updates rep(E), which modulates lr in B.

```
Field(military): "US strikes Iran"   INVOLVES [Trump]
Field(politics): "25th Amendment"    INVOLVES [Trump]
  → rep(Trump) accumulated from BOTH → modulates BOTH
```

**Self-reference**: KB(self) points into KB(world). (R4)

```
S_k: "confidence in B_i is high" references B_i directly
  The edge IS the self-awareness
```

**Meta-reference**: Beliefs about relationships between fields.

```
M_1: "military escalation drives political crisis"
  emerges from observing entity bridges (reflect)
```

### 7.2 Circular Causation (R5: Converge)

R5 governs all feedback loops in the system. Three instances:

**Entity ↔ Belief** (primary, always active):
```
rep(E) → lr(claim) → Λ(B) → rep(E)
  attenuation: σ(E) = 1/√n < 1
  convergence: Banach fixed-point
```
See §8 for full treatment. This is the first R5 cycle that
activates — as soon as entities participate in multiple beliefs.

**Causal cycles** (activates in mature trees):
```
Sanctions → poverty → radicalization → conflict → sanctions
  traversal n: lr × αⁿ → 0
  total: lr × α/(1-α)    finite
```

**Self-reference** (R4 + R5):
```
Ψ(KB) → KB_self → Ψ(KB_self) → KB_meta → ...
  level n: Λ × αⁿ → 0
  total: Λ / (1-α)    finite
```

All three are the same mechanism: a cycle where each traversal
contributes less. R5 guarantees convergence in all cases.
At any moment, m is a valid posterior.

### 7.3 Multi-Membership and Weighted Edges

When B participates in multiple parents, mass propagation
is weighted:

```
B has parents {P₁, P₂, P₃} with weights {w₁, w₂, w₃}
  Σ wᵢ = 1 (normalized)

  Δm(Pᵢ) = wᵢ × log(lr)    evidence distributed by weight
```

Weight reflects how strongly B participates in each context.
A belief about "Trump" participates strongly in "political
crisis" (w=0.8) and weakly in "military operations" (w=0.2).

The weights are not assigned — they emerge from structure.
Entity σ (specificity) provides the prior: high fan-out
entities carry less weight per edge.

### 7.4 From Tree to Lattice to Hypergraph

```
Construction     →  tree (R1, R2, fast, tractable)
Maturation       →  lattice (R6 activates, cross-references)
Full integration →  hypergraph (R4, R5 activate, cycles, self-ref)
```

The hypergraph maps to the organism:
- **Ω** = the full multiply-connected KB (structure)
- **ψ** = individual belief states m, |V| (local)
- **Φ** = emergent coherence from R3 (global)

### 7.5 Emergence (R3: Centroid Convergence)

Emergence is a Markov state transition: when two root subtree
centroids converge past θ, they belong to the same field.

```
∀ root_i, root_j:
  sim(root_i.subtree_centroid, root_j.subtree_centroid) > θ:
    smaller → IMPLIES → larger
    larger.subtree_centroid ← weighted_mean(both)
```

θ = 0.55. Mechanical (no LLM). Runs after every sense pass.

The subtree centroid is a running average — updated on every
_write_edge as new beliefs join. It tracks the field's
aboutness as evidence accumulates. Identity is not a label
but a point in embedding space that drifts with evidence.

Recursive: the same mechanism applies at every level.
claims → beliefs → fields → meta-fields → worldview.
Same θ, same centroid convergence, same merge operation.

Fields can nest: a field within a field is a sub-field.
A meta-field emerges when field centroids converge.


## 8. Entities as Circular Causation (R5 Instance)

Entities are the primary instance of R5 in the system. The
entity ↔ belief feedback loop is circular causation:

```
rep(E) → lr(claim) → Λ(B) → rep(E) → ...
```

This is not a separate mechanism. It is R1 (accumulation) applied
to entities, creating a cycle that R5 (convergence) resolves.

### 8.1 Entity Reputation (R1 Applied)

```
E := ⟨id, name, rep, Λ_E, n⟩

  rep   = σ(Λ_E)                          R1: same Jaynes posterior
  Λ_E   = Σ σ(E) × w(role_i) × Λ(B_i)   for B_i INVOLVES E
  σ(E)  = 1 / √n(E)                       specificity: fan-out attenuation
  n     = |{B : B INVOLVES E}|
```

Three roles, one calculus:

```
source    w = 1.0    "CNN reported X"     → X reflects on CNN
subject   w = 0.5    "Trump threatened Y" → Y reflects on Trump
mentioned w = 0.1    "at the Strait"      → weak association
```

σ ensures high fan-out entities change slowly (Trump, n=50, σ=0.14)
while low fan-out entities are defined by their few appearances
(Dr. Baden, n=1, σ=1.0). Same σ principle as FW binding.

### 8.2 The R5 Cycle

```
claim c from source E arrives
  lr(c) = lr_base(c) × (0.5 + rep(E))    rep modulates lr
  belief B accumulates c                   R1
  B.mass changes
  Λ_E recalculated from B.mass            R1 on entity
  future claims from E carry new rep(E)    cycle continues
```

This IS circular causation: entity → belief → entity.
R5 guarantees convergence:
- σ is bounded [0,1]
- g(rep) = 0.5 + rep is sublinear
- Each traversal's influence < 1 (contraction)
- Banach fixed-point theorem → unique fixed point

At the fixed point: entity reputation and belief masses are
mutually consistent. No iteration needed at runtime — the
system converges incrementally with each claim.

### 8.3 Entities as Entanglement (R6 Consequence)

R6 (entangle) is not a graph operation. It is a consequence
of R5 operating through shared entities.

```
Field(military): "US strikes Iran"     INVOLVES [Trump]
Field(politics): "25th Amendment"      INVOLVES [Trump]
```

Trump's reputation accumulates from BOTH fields. A new claim
about Trump lands in one field but updates rep(Trump) globally,
which modulates lr in ALL fields. The entity IS the hyperedge.

Cross-field information flow requires no explicit edges —
it emerges from the R5 cycle operating across INVOLVES.

### 8.4 Levels

```
Level 0:  Claims      → raw assertions
Level 1:  Beliefs     → R1 accumulation, R2 structure
Level 2:  Entities    → R1 + R5 (circular: belief ↔ entity)
Level 3:  Fields      → R3 emergence (centroid convergence)
Level 4:  Self-model  → R4 (Ψ: same calculus on own state)
```

Each level boundary is an R5 cycle. Each uses the same six rules.
No new mechanisms at any level — only the same calculus applied
to the output of the level below.


## 9. Walkthrough Example

A building collapses. Claims arrive from multiple sources.

### Step 1: First claim

```
c₁: "A five-story building collapsed in central district this morning"
    source: local_news, modality: observation

KB: (empty)
→ ⊢ P1 "building collapsed in central district"

Gene:
  P1: "building collapsed in central district"
```

### Step 2: Supporting detail

```
c₂: "Rescue teams have pulled three survivors from the rubble"
    source: fire_dept, modality: observation

→ ⊢ P2 →P1 "survivors rescued from rubble"

Gene:
  P1: "building collapsed in central district"
    P2: "survivors rescued from rubble"
```

### Step 3: Confirmation

```
c₃: "The building came down around 8am, trapping dozens"
    source: witness, modality: observation

→ ⊨ P1              -- same fact, different wording

Gene:
  P1: "building collapsed in central district" [2v]
    P2: "survivors rescued from rubble"
```

### Step 4: Amendment

```
c₄: "Officials confirmed the collapse, saying it was a residential building"
    source: city_official, modality: reported_speech

→ ⊨ P1 ∧ δ"residential"

Gene:
  P1: "building collapsed; residential" [3v]
    P2: "survivors rescued from rubble"
```

### Step 5: Dispute emerges

```
c₅: "The building owner denied any structural violations"
    source: building_owner, modality: reported_speech

→ ⊢ P3 →P1 "structural violations alleged"
  ⊢ P4 ⊥P3 "owner denies violations"

Gene:
  P1: "building collapsed; residential" [3v]
    P2: "survivors rescued from rubble"
    P3: "structural violations alleged"
      ⊥ P4: "owner denies violations"
```

The denial reveals TWO propositions — the denied thing and the
denial itself. Disputes enter the tree structurally.

### Step 6: Unrelated topic

```
c₆: "City council approved new building safety regulations last month"
    source: city_records, modality: observation

→ ⊢ P5 "new safety regulations approved"

Gene:
  P1: "building collapsed; residential" [3v]
    P2: "survivors rescued from rubble"
    P3: "structural violations alleged"
      ⊥ P4: "owner denies violations"
  P5: "new safety regulations approved"
```

### Step 7: Evidence and mass

```
P1: Λ = log(1.50) + log(1.50) + log(1.12) = 0.92
    m = σ(0.92) = 0.72,  |V| = 3

P3: Λ = 0 + log(1/1.12) = -0.11     (counter shifts down)
    m = σ(-0.11) = 0.47,  |V| = 0

P4: Λ = log(1.12) = 0.11
    m = σ(0.11) = 0.53,  |V| = 1
```

### Final tree

```
(m=0.72, 3v)  P1: "building collapsed; residential"
  (m=0.54, 1v)  P2: "survivors rescued" →P1
  (m=0.47, 0v)  P3: "violations alleged" →P1
    (m=0.53, 1v)  ⊥ P4: "owner denies" ⊥P3
(m=0.54, 1v)  P5: "safety regulations approved"
```

```

### Jeffrey Epstein Death Investigation (75 claims, 30 pages)

```
Pass 1: 47 propositions, 2 roots
Pass 2: 75/75 claims processed

  P1  "Epstein died in custody"           m=0.86  10v
  P3  "Baden: homicide, neck fractures"   m=0.56   1v
  P5  "Sampson rules suicide"             m=0.59   2v  ⊥P3
  P12 "found with bedsheet ligature"      m=0.63   3v
```

### Comparison

| Metric | Fighter jet | Epstein death |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Claims | 93 | 75 |
| Propositions | 44 | 47 |
| Roots | 3 | 2 |
| Top mass | 0.91 (21v) | 0.86 (10v) |
| Disputes | severity (→ vs ⊥) | cause of death (→ vs ⊥) |

Same language, same five operations, different domains. Both produce
correct epistemic structure with disputes visible and mass
accumulating from independent sources.

### Full Pipeline Test (54 claims, 3 pages, v2 claim trees)

2026-04-08: Three diverse pages through the complete pipe
(EW v2 → Sense with claim tree drag → PG ANN landing).

```
Pages:
  25th Amendment (11 claims) — political/institutional
  Epstein files (22 claims) — investigative/contested
  Iran ceasefire (21 claims) — military/diplomatic

Results: 38 beliefs, 4 roots, 34 edges (26 IMPLIES + 8 DISPUTES)
         13 beliefs with multiple voices (R1 accumulation)
         8 genuine DISPUTES (every one a real disagreement)
         $0.086 total ($0.002 + $0.039 + $0.045)
```

Key findings:

**Claim tree drag eliminates LLM for 90%+ claims**: The 25th Amendment
page used 1 LLM call for 11 claims ($0.002). EW's typed relations
(causes/counters/evidence/elaborates) drove placement mechanically.

**Correct epistemic structure per field**:
- 25th Amendment: Trump threat → Democrat push → debate (for/against/mechanism).
  Clean causal chain with DISPUTES for partisan opposition.
- Epstein: Case files → FBI material → surveillance → competing narratives.
  DISPUTES correctly mark official ruling vs conspiracy evidence.
- Iran: Content correct but too flat (12 depth-1 children). Caused by
  EW extracting most claims as `elaborates` instead of `causes`.

**8 DISPUTES edges, all genuine**:
1. Strait of Hormuz open ⊥ missiles across Gulf (fact tension)
2. Araqchi ready for ceasefire ⊥ hopes faded (diplomatic contradiction)
3. Khamenei not killed ⊥ conflicting statements (correction)
4. Prison staff story ⊥ case files (competing narratives)
5. Medical examiner suicide ⊥ case files (official vs contested)
6. Republicans ⊥ Democrats on 25th (partisan opposition)
7. DOJ Inspector General ⊥ prison staff (institutional counter)
8. Officials haven't confirmed ⊥ prison staff (official silence)

**PG ANN landing works**: Iran ceasefire page correctly landed on
Trump threat field (sim=0.631) via subtree centroid search.

**Emergence threshold correct**: Iran ↔ 25th at sim=0.520 (below 0.55).
They're related (Trump links both) but genuinely different fields.
Epstein fully isolated (sim=0.22). System correctly kept all separate.

**Per-root heal validated**: Global heal degraded edge entropy
(0.563→0.570) while collapsing roots. Per-root heal preserves
root structure while making correct local restructures.
